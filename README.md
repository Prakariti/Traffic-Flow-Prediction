# Traffic Flow Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts traffic flow conditions using historical traffic data and Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to support smart city traffic management.

## Objectives
- Analyze traffic patterns  
- Predict congestion levels  
- Compare Machine Learning and Deep Learning models  

## Dataset
Kaggle Traffic Prediction Dataset  
Features include:
- Date
- Time
- Vehicle Counts (Car, Bike, Bus, Truck)
- Traffic Situation

## Models Used
- XGBoost  
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  

## Results
